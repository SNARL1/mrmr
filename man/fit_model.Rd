\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of data generated by the function
\code{mrmr::clean_data()}.}

\item{seed}{(positive integer(s)) A seed for the (P)RNG to pass to CmdStan.
In the case of multi-chain sampling the single \code{seed} will automatically be
augmented by the the run (chain) ID so that each chain uses a different
seed. The exception is the transformed data block, which defaults to
using same seed for all chains so that the same data is generated for all
chains if RNG functions are used. The only time \code{seed} should be specified
as a vector (one element per chain) is if RNG functions are used in
transformed data and the goal is to generate \emph{different} data for each
chain.}

\item{refresh}{(non-negative integer) The number of iterations between
printed screen updates. If \code{refresh = 0}, only error messages will be
printed.}

\item{init}{(multiple options) The initialization method to use for the
variables declared in the parameters block of the Stan program. One of
the following:
\itemize{
\item A real number \code{x>0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters randomly between
\verb{[-x,x]} on the \emph{unconstrained} parameter space.;
\item The number \code{0}. This initializes \emph{all} parameters to \code{0};
\item A character vector of paths (one per chain) to JSON or Rdump files
containing initial values for all or some parameters. See
\code{\link[cmdstanr:write_stan_json]{write_stan_json()}} to write \R objects to JSON files compatible with
CmdStan.
\item A list of lists containing initial values for all or some parameters. For
MCMC the list should contain a sublist for each chain. For optimization and
variational inference there should be just one sublist. The sublists should
have named elements corresponding to the parameters for which you are
specifying initial values. See \strong{Examples}.
\item A function that returns a single list with names corresponding to the
parameters for which you are specifying initial values. The function can
take no arguments or a single argument \code{chain_id}. For MCMC, if the function
has argument \code{chain_id} it will be supplied with the chain id (from 1 to
number of chains) when called to generate the initial values. See
\strong{Examples}.
}}

\item{save_latent_dynamics}{(logical) Should auxiliary diagnostic information
about the latent dynamics be written to temporary diagnostic CSV files?
This argument replaces CmdStan's \code{diagnostic_file} argument and the content
written to CSV is controlled by the user's CmdStan installation and not
CmdStanR (for some algorithms no content may be written). The default
is \code{FALSE}, which is appropriate for almost every use case. To save the
temporary files created when \code{save_latent_dynamics=TRUE} see the
\code{\link[cmdstanr:fit-method-save_latent_dynamics_files]{$save_latent_dynamics_files()}}
method.}

\item{output_dir}{(string) A path to a directory where CmdStan should write
its output CSV files. For interactive use this can typically be left at
\code{NULL} (temporary directory) since CmdStanR makes the CmdStan output
(posterior draws and diagnostics) available in \R via methods of the fitted
model objects. The behavior of \code{output_dir} is as follows:
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL} (the default), then the CSV files are written to a temporary
directory and only saved permanently if the user calls one of the \verb{$save_*}
methods of the fitted model object (e.g.,
\code{\link[cmdstanr:fit-method-save_output_files]{$save_output_files()}}). These temporary
files are removed when the fitted model object is
\link[base:gc]{garbage collected} (manually or automatically).
\item If a path, then the files are created in \code{output_dir} with names
corresponding to the defaults used by \verb{$save_output_files()}.
}}

\item{output_basename}{(string) A string to use as a prefix for the names of
the output CSV files of CmdStan. If \code{NULL} (the default), the basename of
the output CSV files will be comprised from the model name, timestamp, and
5 random characters.}

\item{sig_figs}{(positive integer) The number of significant figures used
when storing the output values. By default, CmdStan represent the output
values with 6 significant figures. The upper limit for \code{sig_figs} is 18.
Increasing this value will result in larger output CSV files and thus an
increased usage of disk space.}

\item{chains}{(positive integer) The number of Markov chains to run. The
default is 4.}

\item{parallel_chains}{(positive integer) The \emph{maximum} number of MCMC chains
to run in parallel. If \code{parallel_chains} is not specified then the default
is to look for the option \code{"mc.cores"}, which can be set for an entire \R
session by \code{options(mc.cores=value)}. If the \code{"mc.cores"} option has not
been set then the default is \code{1}.}

\item{chain_ids}{(integer vector) A vector of chain IDs. Must contain as many
unique positive integers as the number of chains. If not set, the default
chain IDs are used (integers starting from \code{1}).}

\item{threads_per_chain}{(positive integer) If the model was
\link[cmdstanr:model-method-compile]{compiled} with threading support, the number of
threads to use in parallelized sections \emph{within} an MCMC chain (e.g., when
using the Stan functions \code{reduce_sum()} or \code{map_rect()}). This is in
contrast with \code{parallel_chains}, which specifies the number of chains to
run in parallel. The actual number of CPU cores used is
\code{parallel_chains*threads_per_chain}. For an example of using threading see
the Stan case study
\href{https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html}{Reduce Sum: A Minimal Example}.}

\item{opencl_ids}{(integer vector of length 2) The platform and
device IDs of the OpenCL device to use for fitting. The model must
be compiled with \code{cpp_options = list(stan_opencl = TRUE)} for this
argument to have an effect.}

\item{iter_warmup}{(positive integer) The number of warmup iterations to run
per chain. Note: in the CmdStan User's Guide this is referred to as
\code{num_warmup}.}

\item{iter_sampling}{(positive integer) The number of post-warmup iterations
to run per chain. Note: in the CmdStan User's Guide this is referred to as
\code{num_samples}.}

\item{save_warmup}{(logical) Should warmup iterations be saved? The default
is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{thin}{(positive integer) The period between saved samples. This should
typically be left at its default (no thinning) unless memory is a problem.}

\item{max_treedepth}{(positive integer) The maximum allowed tree depth for
the NUTS engine. See the \emph{Tree Depth} section of the CmdStan User's Guide
for more details.}

\item{adapt_engaged}{(logical) Do warmup adaptation? The default is \code{TRUE}.
If a precomputed inverse metric is specified via the \code{inv_metric} argument
(or \code{metric_file}) then, if \code{adapt_engaged=TRUE}, Stan will use the
provided inverse metric just as an initial guess during adaptation. To turn
off adaptation when using a precomputed inverse metric set
\code{adapt_engaged=FALSE}.}

\item{adapt_delta}{(real in \verb{(0,1)}) The adaptation target acceptance
statistic.}

\item{step_size}{(positive real) The \emph{initial} step size for the discrete
approximation to continuous Hamiltonian dynamics. This is further tuned
during warmup.}

\item{metric}{(string) One of \code{"diag_e"}, \code{"dense_e"}, or \code{"unit_e"},
specifying the geometry of the base manifold. See the \emph{Euclidean Metric}
section of the CmdStan User's Guide for more details. To specify a
precomputed (inverse) metric, see the \code{inv_metric} argument below.}

\item{metric_file}{(character vector) The paths to JSON or
Rdump files (one per chain) compatible with CmdStan that contain
precomputed inverse metrics. The \code{metric_file} argument is inherited from
CmdStan but is confusing in that the entry in JSON or Rdump file(s) must be
named \code{inv_metric}, referring to the \emph{inverse} metric. We recommend instead
using CmdStanR's \code{inv_metric} argument (see below) to specify an inverse
metric directly using a vector or matrix from your \R session.}

\item{inv_metric}{(vector, matrix) A vector (if \code{metric='diag_e'}) or a
matrix (if \code{metric='dense_e'}) for initializing the inverse metric. This
can be used as an alternative to the \code{metric_file} argument. A vector is
interpreted as a diagonal metric. The inverse metric is usually set to an
estimate of the posterior covariance. See the \code{adapt_engaged} argument
above for details about (and control over) how specifying a precomputed
inverse metric interacts with adaptation.}

\item{init_buffer}{(nonnegative integer) Width of initial fast timestep
adaptation interval during warmup.}

\item{term_buffer}{(nonnegative integer) Width of final fast timestep
adaptation interval during warmup.}

\item{window}{(nonnegative integer) Initial width of slow timestep/metric
adaptation interval.}

\item{fixed_param}{(logical) When \code{TRUE}, call CmdStan with argument
\code{"algorithm=fixed_param"}. The default is \code{FALSE}. The fixed parameter
sampler generates a new sample without changing the current state of the
Markov chain; only generated quantities may change. This can be useful
when, for example, trying to generate pseudo-data using the generated
quantities block. If the parameters block is empty then using
\code{fixed_param=TRUE} is mandatory. When \code{fixed_param=TRUE} the \code{chains} and
\code{parallel_chains} arguments will be set to \code{1}.}

\item{show_messages}{(logical) When \code{TRUE} (the default), prints all
output during the sampling process, such as iteration numbers and elapsed times.
If the output is silenced then the \code{\link[cmdstanr:fit-method-output]{$output()}} method of
the resulting fit object can be used to display the silenced messages.}

\item{compile}{(logical) Do compilation? The default is \code{TRUE}. If \code{FALSE}
compilation can be done later via the \code{\link[cmdstanr:model-method-compile]{$compile()}}
method.}

\item{...}{Optionally, additional arguments to pass to the
\code{\link[cmdstanr:model-method-compile]{$compile()}} method if \code{compile=TRUE}. These
options include specifying the directory for saving the executable, turning
on pedantic mode, specifying include paths, configuring C++ options, and
more. See \code{\link[cmdstanr:model-method-compile]{$compile()}} for details.}
}
\value{
A list containing the model object, extracted posterior draws, and
input data.

\description{
Fits the multistate mark recapture model using cmdstanr. Most of the
arguments to this function are inherited from the `sample()` method in
cmdstanr, providing fine-tuned control over the posterior sampling.
}
\details{
To use within-chain parallelization, provide the following arguments:

1. `cpp_options = list(stan_threads = TRUE)` to compile with threading

2. `threads_per_chain` set to some integer value > 1.
