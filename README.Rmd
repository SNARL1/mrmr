# mrmr: mark recapture miscellany in R :frog:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mbjoseph/mrmr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mbjoseph/mrmr)

This package automates common data processing steps for mark recapture data, with an emphasis on data collected by folks at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Lab (SNARL). 
It makes some very specific assumptions about the structure of the data in order to construct observation and occurrence matrices. 
This package is intended to be used along with something like [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) to fit hierarchical Bayesian mark recapture models. 

(Not to be confused with the greatest musical group of the 20th century, Mister Mister)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mbjoseph/mrmr")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(mrmr)
mr_data <- load_mr("tests/testthat/ex.xlsx")
mr_data
```

We may want to create an observation matrix, augmented with M all zero encounter histories:

```{r}
Y <- getY(mr_data, M = 50)
str(Y)
plot(Y)
```

Or perhaps an incompletely observed occurrence matrix:

```{r}
Z <- getZ(Y)
str(Z)
plot(Z)
```
